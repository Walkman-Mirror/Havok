It Is Built In VB.Net and Also Uses GeckoFX For The Built In Web-browser Component and Source Viewer. Havok Will Always Be Free and Open-Source.\r\n\r\n### How Did This Become?\r\nWell, damn simple, I started like all evil, wanting some peepz code (Remember this was a while back, I ain't your script kiddie, I actually write my own code, and If  I do a copy and paste I will credit that person who wrote it and try to figure out what the code means and is doing)anyway, as I was saying, I was like le' meh' totally write or copy (Sorry Script Kiddie Style, Again Reference To Time Period Back Then)this UDP Flooder code, so I did, but even before this it was a what I call a _Super Extreme CMD Pinger_ and before that it was a _Web Browser Looping Continuous Navigator_ all three which were totally _Script Kiddied_ of course I do look for TCP Flooder code and I have messed around before by copying UDP Flooder code and then **Kinda' Converting It** to TCP Client Flooder. Anyways after that I started adding many more features I had learned over time and at this day I am proud to say I have learned so far in this period of time an awesome amount of the VB.Net language, (Okay like not so far, but I am into dimming and that stuff, but I will get to the other parts soon, in time.) One day I introduced GeckoFX into it, which if you do not know is the layout engine for Mozilla's Firefox, well Gecko to be precise, _Gecko FX_ is the .Net port of the Gecko layout engine (If I am not mistaken.) Before that I adding the HGetter and HPusher which are download and upload clients respectively and that took a long time because damn there was code everywhere on my screen. I also have added the _UDP-Flooder Info Box_ which shows you what data has been received when you are flooding a server or possibly machine.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshots are coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nHavok should work on 32-Bit and 64-Bit Windows machines (WinXP and Up). It will have compatibility on 64-Bit machines since Havok is compiled on a 32-Bit machine this means that WOW64 (Windows on WIndows 64) will then obviously be in use.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n*  Not released yet, still under development.\r\n\r\nView the latest changelog [here](https://deavmi.github.com/Havok/changelog/online_changelog.txt)\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n### Application\r\n\r\n*  Still under development.\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nTo download the latest source code please [click this link](https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/zipball/master).
