It Is Built In VB.Net and Also Uses GeckoFX For The Built In Web-browser Component and Source Viewer. Havok Will Always Be Free and Open-Source.\r\n\r\n### How Did This Become?\r\nWell, damn simple, I started like all evil, wanting some peepz code (Remember this was a while back, I ain't your script kiddie, I actually write my own code, and If  I do a copy and paste I will credit that person who wrote it and try to figure out what the code means and is doing)anyway, as I was saying, I was like le' meh' totally write or copy (Sorry Script Kiddie Style, Again Reference To Time Period Back Then)this UDP Flooder code, so I did, but even before this it was a what I call a _Super Extreme CMD Pinger_ and before that it was a _Web Browser Looping Continuous Navigator_ all three which were totally _Script Kiddied_ of course I do look for TCP Flooder code and I have messed around before by copying UDP Flooder code and then **Kinda' Converting It** to TCP Client Flooder. Anyways after that I started adding many more features I had learned over time and at this day I am proud to say I have learned so far in this period of time an awesome amount of the VB.Net language, (Okay like not so far into dimming and that stuff but I will get there.) One day I introduced GeckoFX into it, which if you do not know is the layout engine for Mozilla's Firefox, well Gecko to be precise, _Gecko FX_ is the .Net port of the Gecko layout engine (If I am not mistaken.) Before that I adding the HGetter and HPusher which are download and upload clients respectively and that took a long time because damn there was code everywhere on my screen. I also have added the _UDP-Flooder Info Box_ which shows you what data has been received when you are flooding a server or possibly machine.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshots are coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nHavok is currently only compatible for 32-Bit arch machines but you could help out with a 64-Bit arch version of Havok by re-compiling the source code on your 64-Bit machine and pushing it to the _[master64](https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/tree/master64)_ branch.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nView the latest changelog [here](https://deavmi.github.com/Havok/changelog/online_changelog.txt)\r\n\r\n## Source code\r\n\r\nPlease note that when downloading the source code you are downloading the 32-Bit one, hence _[master](https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/tree/master)_ being the default, no worries it is just two lines different, in that you are downloading the 64-Bit update package, named 'havok-64.zip' and then the fact that it must be compiled on a 64-Bit machine. You can visit the repository page _[here on GitHub](https://github.com/deavmi/Havok)_ and then switch your branch to _[master64](https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/tree/master64)_ branch. Then everything is sorted, head-over to the downloas section [here](http://deavmi.github.io/Havok/#downloads).\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n### Application\r\n\r\n* [Havok Binary for 32-Bit (Not available)]()\r\n* [Havok Binary for 64-Bit (Not available]()\r\n* [Havok Binary for 32-Bit (Nightly)](https://deavmi.github.com/Havok/updates/nightly/Release.exe)\r\n* [Havok Binary for 64-Bit (Nightly - Not available)]()\r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\n* [Havok Source Code for 32-Bit (.zip)](https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/zipball/master)\r\n* [Havok Source Code for 32-Bit (.tar.gz)](https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/tarball/master)\r\n* [Havok Source Code for 64-Bit (.zip)](https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/zipball/master64)\r\n* [Havok Source Code for 64-Bit (.tar.gz)](https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/tarball/master64)\r\n\r\nNOTICE: Nightly builds are only in 32-Bit unless we have a build-slave around with a 64-Bit machine.
