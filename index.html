<h3>
<a name="what-is-havok" class="anchor" href="#what-is-havok"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Is Havok?</h3>

<p>Havok Is An Advanced Web and Networking Tool For Anyone To Use. It Is Built In VB.Net and Also Uses GeckoFX For The Built In Web-browser Component and Source Viewer. Havok Will Always Be Free and Open-Source.</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-did-this-become" class="anchor" href="#how-did-this-become"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How Did This Become?</h3>

<p>Well, damn simple, I started like all evil, wanting some peepz code (Remember this was a while back, I ain't your script kiddie, I actually write my own code, and If  I do a copy and paste I will credit that person who wrote it and try to figure out what the code means and is doing)anyway, as I was saying, I was like le' meh' totally write or copy (Sorry Script Kiddie Style, Again Reference To Time Period Back Then)this UDP Flooder code, so I did, but even before this it was a what I call a <em>Super Extreme CMD Pinger</em> and before that it was a <em>Web Browser Looping Continuous Navigator</em> all three which were totally <em>Script Kiddied</em> of course I do look for TCP Flooder code and I have messed around before by copying UDP Flooder code and then <strong>Kinda' Converting It</strong> to TCP Client Flooder. Anyways after that I started adding many more features I had learned over time and at this day I am proud to say I have learned so far in this period of time an awesome amount of the VB.Net language, (Okay like not so far into dimming and that stuff but I will get there.) One day I introduced GeckoFX into it, which if you do not know is the layout engine for Mozilla's Firefox, well Gecko to be precise, <em>Gecko FX</em> is the .Net port of the Gecko layout engine (If I am not mistaken.) Before that I adding the HGetter and HPusher which are download and upload clients respectively and that took a long time because damn there was code everywhere on my screen. I also have added the <em>UDP-Flooder Info Box</em> which shows you what data has been received when you are flooding a server or possibly machine.</p>

<p>Screenshots are coming soon.</p>

<h2>
<a name="compatibility" class="anchor" href="#compatibility"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Havok is currently only compatible for 32-Bit arch machines but you could help out with a 64-Bit arch version of Havok by re-compiling the source code on your 64-Bit machine and pushing it to the <em><a href="https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/tree/master64">master64</a></em> branch.</p>

<h2>
<a name="changelog" class="anchor" href="#changelog"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changelog</h2>

<p>There is no available changelog.</p>

<h2>
<a name="source-code" class="anchor" href="#source-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Source code</h2>

<p>Please note that when downloading the source code you are downloading the 32-Bit one, hence <em><a href="https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/tree/master">master</a></em> being the default, no worries it is just two lines different, in that you are downloading the 64-Bit update package, named 'havok-64.zip' and then the fact that it must be compiled on a 64-Bit machine. You can visit the repository page <em><a href="https://github.com/deavmi/Havok">here on GitHub</a></em> and then switch your branch to <em><a href="https://github.com/deavmi/Havok/tree/master64">master64</a></em> branch. Then everything is sorted, head-over to the downloas section <a href="http://deavmi.github.io/Havok/#downloads">here</a>.</p>
