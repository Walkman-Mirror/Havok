Havok is a free and open-source networking tool and web tool for Windows.

Please leave comments, feature requests, bugs and kind words here: http://deavmi.github.io/Havok/feedback/

Currently in a beta phase, nightlies coming out, soon there will be a stable version very, very soon. Please
visit http://deavmi.github.io/Havok for more information. Also you may contact me for feature requests, testimonials or
bugs at tristankildaire@gmail.com

Please note on install time, Havok does require the dynamic link library "DevComponents.DotNetbar2.dll", so when you install Havok, this file will automatically be downloaded. But for developers, please use the ShitBrick-Tool to download this file with ease <http://bit.ly/shitbrick-utility>

This description will soon be replaced by a way better one.
